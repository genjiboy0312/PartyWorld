# Surface registers

Use this reference to apply one language dossier across surfaces without flattening every surface into the same voice. The shared rule is simple: use canonical nouns and canonical verbs from `LANGUAGE.md`, then adapt density, proof, and recovery detail to the surface.

Service-vernacular owns terminology and register evidence. Impeccable owns detailed UI copy mechanics. documentation-sdk owns docs, API reference, SDK, and release-note structure. Keep those boundaries clear.

Required surfaces covered: UI, docs, CLI, notifications, backend/API product-facing errors, admin/operator, onboarding, support, release notes, homepage hero, product/service page, proof panel, route card, CTA/link, caption/diagram label, metadata/fallback text, localized-copy.

## Shared register rules

1. Start from evidence, not brand invention.
2. Keep internal names out of user-facing text unless users already know them.
3. Prefer precise domain nouns over vague platform nouns.
4. Prefer workflow verbs over generic action verbs when the domain evidence supports them.
5. Keep generic standard labels when they are clearest, familiar, or accessibility-critical.
6. Preserve contract fields named in `contract-safety.md`.
7. Avoid over-branding. A term can be distinctive without sounding like a mascot.

## Homepage hero

Register: public, immediate, and grounded in the visitor's first decision.

Homepage hero copy should say what the service is, who it helps, and what the visitor can safely do next. It may carry brand confidence, but only from evidence such as product facts, approved positioning, customer proof, or visible service capabilities.

Evidence to inspect: homepage brief, product facts, company positioning, customer proof, analytics intent, primary CTA target, route map, localization source, and current hero text.

Keep generic when clearest: short navigation labels, `Learn more`, `Contact us`, `Sign in`, and other standard paths may stay familiar when they point to predictable destinations.

Avoid: internal page-review notes, sequencing instructions, abstract trust claims, and sentences that describe the page instead of speaking to the visitor.

## Product/service page

Register: explanatory, proof-aware, and specific to the service promise.

Product and service pages should name the offer, the user or buyer problem, and the evidence-backed capability boundary. Do not turn internal product taxonomy into public copy unless that taxonomy is already public and useful.

Evidence to inspect: service descriptions, feature inventory, diagrams, technical docs, sales collateral, customer questions, support limits, pricing boundaries, and approved claim language.

Keep generic when clearest: standard section labels such as `Features`, `Services`, `Pricing`, `Security`, and `FAQ` may remain generic when they help scanning.

Avoid: claim stacking, unsupported category leadership, filler phrases, or translating an internal section note into visitor-facing prose.

## Proof panel

Register: factual, cited, and modest.

Proof panels should expose verifiable evidence such as deployments, case studies, certifications, measured outcomes, customer quotes, integration facts, or audit scope. If the proof is still under review, keep that review status out of public copy.

Evidence to inspect: approved metrics, customer approvals, compliance artifacts, public case studies, screenshots, benchmark notes, and legal or brand approvals.

Keep generic when clearest: neutral labels such as `Results`, `Evidence`, `Customers`, `Partners`, and `Case studies` may remain generic.

Avoid: inventing certainty, implying forensic or compliance guarantees, or using QA-language to explain why a claim was limited.

## Route card

Register: choice-oriented, parallel, and predictable.

Route cards should help visitors choose between products, services, industries, docs, contact paths, or support paths. Each card needs a clear destination, a distinct reason to choose it, and a label that matches the linked route.

Evidence to inspect: sitemap, route names, IA notes, card destinations, product families, visitor segments, analytics events, and current navigation labels.

Keep generic when clearest: common route labels may stay standard when they reduce choice friction.

Avoid: cards that repeat the same value phrase, hide the destination, or use internal routing notes as display text.

## CTA/link

Register: action-specific, honest, and destination-matched.

CTA and link text should tell the visitor what happens after selection. Match the verb to the destination, the commitment level, and the current surface. A service inquiry link should not sound like a product launch, and a docs link should not sound like a sales conversion.

Evidence to inspect: target URL, form behavior, modal behavior, auth requirement, sales process, route title, analytics name, and accessibility label.

Keep generic when clearest: `Learn more`, `View docs`, `Contact sales`, `Get started`, and `Sign in` may remain generic when the target is obvious and accessible.

Avoid: vague verbs, bait-and-switch destinations, inflated verbs such as `unlock`, and links that only make sense beside surrounding prose.

## Caption/diagram label

Register: explanatory, compact, and tied to the visual.

Captions and diagram labels should name what the visual proves or clarifies. They should not carry the whole product pitch, and they should not add claims the visual does not show.

Evidence to inspect: diagram source, alt text, design annotations, product architecture notes, component labels, and any localized caption source.

Keep generic when clearest: standard labels such as `Architecture`, `Workflow`, `Before`, `After`, and `Example` may remain generic.

Avoid: decorative captions, unlabeled acronyms, or labels that require internal architecture knowledge.

## Metadata/fallback text

Register: concise, searchable, and safe when seen out of context.

Metadata, SEO snippets, social cards, empty fallbacks, alt fallbacks, and route titles should preserve the public claim boundary even when detached from the page. These strings often appear in search, previews, and assistive contexts, so they need standalone clarity.

Evidence to inspect: page title, meta description, Open Graph fields, structured data, fallback components, localization files, screenshots, and generated route names.

Keep generic when clearest: product names, company names, and standard fallback labels may remain simple when clarity beats novelty.

Avoid: stuffing keywords, expanding claims for search, or using placeholder copy that can leak into public previews.

## Localized-copy review

Register: native to the locale, meaning-preserving, and surface-aware.

Localized-copy review checks whether translated, bilingual, or transcreated text preserves source intent, claim boundary, surface purpose, and next action while reading like native locale public copy. The target line may change order, rhythm, idiom, proof order, or CTA shape when the transcreation decision calls for it, but it must not change the promise.

Evidence to inspect: source copy, target-locale copy, locale dossier, glossary, locale terminology or termbase, do-not-translate terms, approved product names, locale-specific legal or claim notes, cultural/register notes, route context, UI/layout constraints, and target-locale native-review evidence.

Keep generic when clearest: widely understood product names, route labels, standard labels, and technical terms may stay in English or in their approved localized form when that is the public convention.

Check fit: confirm the target copy matches the surface's job, the audience relationship, formality, politeness, punctuation, reading direction, line length, truncation risk, and placeholder grammar.

Avoid: literal English rhythm, missing transcreation decision, internal review terms, mixed-language taxonomy without reason, ignored UI/layout constraints, absent native-review evidence, or a Korean sentence that is accurate but unnatural for public display.

## UI

Register: task-focused, short, and scannable.

Use UI copy to help users complete the immediate workflow. Pull nouns and verbs from `LANGUAGE.md`, then use Impeccable for button labels, field help, empty states, validation phrasing, and accessibility checks.

Evidence to inspect: visible strings, screen titles, flow names, component labels, design notes, user research, support tickets tied to screens.

Keep generic when clearest: `Save`, `Cancel`, `Settings`, `Search`, `Filter`, `Next`, `Back`, and common accessibility labels may remain generic.

Avoid: inventing branded names for standard controls, replacing clear labels with clever terms, or using one domain noun everywhere when a simpler label serves the task.

## Docs

Register: teaching, precise, and task-oriented.

Docs should explain how the product's domain works in the user's workflow. Service-vernacular supplies nouns, verbs, glossary terms, audience context, and claim boundaries. documentation-sdk owns structure for API docs, SDK guides, examples, and release-adjacent writing.

Evidence to inspect: guides, concepts pages, API references, code examples, README sections, migration notes, glossary pages.

Keep generic when clearest: standard headings such as `Overview`, `Quick start`, `Prerequisites`, `Examples`, `Reference`, and `Troubleshooting` may remain generic.

Avoid: marketing filler, undefined jargon, docs that mirror internal architecture before explaining the user task, and generic phrases like "improve productivity" without domain evidence.

## CLI

Register: direct, stable, and script-safe.

CLI text should respect automation and operator habits. Keep commands, flags, exit status, and parseable output stable unless the owning tool change authorizes a contract update.

Evidence to inspect: command names, help output, man pages, examples, shell completions, error output, tests, automation scripts.

Keep generic when clearest: `help`, `version`, `status`, `init`, `login`, `logout`, `config`, and common flag names may remain generic.

Avoid: decorative copy, jokes, unstable synonyms across help and errors, or changing parseable output to sound more human.

## Notifications

Register: timely, concise, and specific about why the user is being interrupted.

Notifications should name the domain event, its impact, and the next useful action when there is one. Match urgency to evidence from severity, workflow state, and user role.

Evidence to inspect: email templates, push messages, in-app banners, webhook messages, event names, severity labels, notification settings.

Keep generic when clearest: severity labels such as `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, and delivery categories may stay standard.

Avoid: vague alerts like "Update available" when the domain event is known, over-personalized urgency, or claims that exceed the product event.

## Backend/API product-facing errors

Register: specific, recovery-oriented, and contract-safe.

Only rewrite the human-facing message or docs explanation. Preserve machine-readable error codes, status codes, enum values, localization keys, log identifiers, telemetry event names, SDK-visible fields, and documented API semantics unless the contract owner explicitly changes them.

Evidence to inspect: OpenAPI specs, error catalogs, handlers, localization files, SDK docs, tests, status-code mappings, support reports.

Keep generic when clearest: protocol terms, HTTP status labels, auth scheme names, and stable SDK field labels should stay standard.

Avoid: changing a code path through wording, hiding a required recovery step, or making a system error sound like a user mistake.

## Admin/operator

Register: diagnostic, calm, and action-ready.

Operator text should help skilled users understand service state, blast radius, owner, and safe next actions. It can be denser than end-user UI, but it still needs plain terms.

Evidence to inspect: runbooks, dashboards, alert rules, log labels, deployment notes, incident reports, service owner maps.

Keep generic when clearest: `Healthy`, `Degraded`, `Offline`, `Retry`, `Rollback`, `Acknowledged`, and other known operational labels may remain generic.

Avoid: softening critical states, renaming known operational concepts for style, or mixing user-facing recovery copy with operator diagnostics.

## Onboarding

Register: guided, confidence-building, and paced by the user's first workflow.

Onboarding should teach the smallest domain model needed to start. Use canonical nouns and verbs early, but define them through the user's task instead of dropping a glossary all at once.

Evidence to inspect: first-run flows, setup guides, welcome emails, sample data, templates, activation metrics, support questions from new users.

Keep generic when clearest: `Get started`, `Continue`, `Skip for now`, `Invite team`, and setup step labels may remain generic when the step is obvious.

Avoid: mascot language, inflated promises, or asking users to learn internal object names before they see the value.

## Support

Register: empathetic, evidence-based, and clear about limits.

Support copy should name the user's workflow, reflect what the product can verify, and guide the next step. It must not create new support-tier claims for this toolkit or product claims the evidence does not support.

Evidence to inspect: help center articles, support macros, incident replies, ticket tags, known issue pages, troubleshooting guides.

Keep generic when clearest: support categories, escalation labels, and clear account or billing labels may stay standard.

Avoid: blaming the user, implying support coverage that policy does not grant, or using generic apology copy without naming the domain issue.

## Release notes

Register: impact-first, concrete, and scoped to shipped behavior.

Release notes should describe what changed for the user, which domain workflow is affected, and what action is needed. Use documentation-sdk when release-note structure, upgrade guidance, or SDK contract detail dominates.

Evidence to inspect: changelog entries, commits, migration guides, API diffs, issue links, support advisories, feature flags.

Keep generic when clearest: change categories such as `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, and `Security` may remain standard.

Avoid: raw commit summaries, vague "various improvements," or claims that a change is available outside the shipped surface.
